# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle_install/android/0/data`. Run Jekyll with `android/0/pckginstallerapp/bundle install`, like so:
#
#     bundle install unzipped jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
